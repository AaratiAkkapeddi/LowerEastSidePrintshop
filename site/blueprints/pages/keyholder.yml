  # The contact tab pre-defines a set of address
  # fields for the contact box at the bottom of the about
  # page. Combining modular content from layouts with
  # pre-defined content from such fields is a great way to
  # offer flexibility and yet keep certain constraints.
  #
  # The form layout is created with two columns,
  # each column has a set of fields

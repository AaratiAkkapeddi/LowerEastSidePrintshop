    # The contact tab pre-defines a set of address
    # fields for the contact box at the bottom of the about
    # page. Combining modular content from layouts with
    # pre-defined content from such fields is a great way to
    # offer flexibility and yet keep certain constraints.
    #
    # The form layout is created with two columns,
    # each column has a set of fields

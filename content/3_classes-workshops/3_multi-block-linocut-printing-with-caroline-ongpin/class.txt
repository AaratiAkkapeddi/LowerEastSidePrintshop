The instructor will show a&nbsp;demonstration on paper preparation and workstation set-up for printing editions. By the end of the class, students will have developed a structured workflow for multi-block images, from image registration to printing an edition of 5-10 prints. Students are encouraged to use the LESP community studio a few hours a week outside of class time to accomplish steps necessary for the next class session.

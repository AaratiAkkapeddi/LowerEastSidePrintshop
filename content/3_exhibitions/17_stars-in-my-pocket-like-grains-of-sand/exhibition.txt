The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from July 17 – September 15, 2013 with a public reception on Wednesday, July 24, from 6-8pm.</p><p><em>I still believe pattern fascinates on its own. And three-sevenths of a pattern, or even a smaller fragment, can fascinate still more— get us really h unkering down, trying to tease out the whole of the figure in the carpet.</em></p><p>Samuel R. Delany</p><p>Participating Artists: Rebecca Bird, Andrew Chan, Heidi duPont, Christina Moroño, Irena Pejovic, Felix Plaza, Elian Stolarsky, and Liz Zanis. The eight artists in Stars in My Pocket like Grains of Sand use abstract imagery—sometimes ephemeral, other times impenetrable—to propose and obscure their personal agendas. The works serve as activators for contemplation and healing, and allow the viewers to play a participant role. The strength of these works is their lack of clarity combined with a state of lucidity that engage the viewer in a collective dreaminess and willful distraction. Visitors are granted the expansive creation of internal/external, or existential points of view simultaneously which encourages their entry into unconscious realms.</p><p></p>"},"id":"8a55edba-b551-439a-a5d8-23d8a3f5c34b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://A97tnVrm23VCXcmG","text":"Press Release"},"id":"beaa8376-6549-4d69-a114-86ff1a75db78","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

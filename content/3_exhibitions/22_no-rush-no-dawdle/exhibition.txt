Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Dahlia Elsayed</p><p>Opening Reception: Wednesday, March 18, from 6 – 8pm<br>Exhibition Dates: March 18, 2015 – June 21, 2015<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present No Rush, No Dawdle guest curated by artist Dahlia Elsayed. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from March 18, 2015 – May 17, 2015 with a public reception on Wednesday, March 18, 6 – 8pm.</p><p>One aspect of any engrossing practice is the occasional disappearance of the sense of clock time, that elusive and enjoyable experience of timelessness when quantitative ticking seems to cease. It is a sweet-spot, which could be described as working with a serene urgency, or acting in a state of deeply conscious auto-pilot. On those days there is no sense of too fast or too slow, too hurried or too labored, or as the philosopher Alan Watts describes being absorbed in one’s work, No rush. No dawdle .</p><p>These notions of perfect pacing might also relate to printmaking itself. Anyone who has experienced the Goldilocks principle specific to this medium – a squeegee pull that’s not too fast, not too slow, the not too deep/not too shallow etching of a plate, the millimeter tweaks of alignments and layers - is familiar with the pleasure of that “just right” state.</p><p>The works selected for this exhibition overtly address ideas of the temporal in either content or process, and sometimes both. Contemporary images appear prematurely aged, vintage images seem brightly saturated. Layers are flattened, histories selectively degraded, traces and processes are explicitly revealed. Gestures show their own sense of perfect timing – lines, shapes and colors that seem spontaneous have been methodically planned. The 9 artists here have all contemplated the clock time and non-clock time of this medium, resulting in works that highlight the varied paces of contemporary printmaking.</p>"},"id":"132818be-eb3d-4dd3-aece-fdb6632f8d28","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://2Zid92eWHl9qKwXR","text":"Press Release"},"id":"e190acc5-4f04-444f-9d4e-a91081e133b5","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

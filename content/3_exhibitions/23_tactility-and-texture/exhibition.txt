Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Benjamin Sutton</p><p>Opening Reception/Holiday Party: Wednesday, December 10, from 6 – 8pm<br>Exhibition Dates: December 10, 2014 – February 8, 2015<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present <em>Tactility and Texture</em> guest curated by Hyperallergic’ s Metro Editor Benjamin Sutton. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from December 10, 2014 – February 8, 2015 with a public reception on Wednesday, December 10, 6-8pm. This exhibition’s doubled title is intended as an acknowledgment of the obvious: the artists included seem to belong in two separate exhibitions. One would be a two-artist show featuring the funny, melancholic, and palpably hairy figures populating Xinyi Cheng’s works alongside Ivan Forde’s surreal, irreverent, and irresistible mashups. The other would feature three artists — Shadi Harouni,</p><p>Ali Medina, and Sarah Smith — whose approaches to abstraction highlight the play of layers and textures in their work. But the juxtaposition of these two seemingly disparate sets of works should also underline their formal connections. Namely, all five artists draw viewers into their work with the vivid and evocative textures they create.</p><p>The sparing but incredibly effective use of color and line in Xinyi Cheng’s work immediately pulls us into the funny, tender, and awkward scenes she depicts. She conjures incredibly evocative surfaces, settings, and situations with subtle means. Ivan Forde, on the other hand, marshals seemingly familiar images and textures to destabilize viewers, placing them in vibrant and strange landscapes. Shadi</p><p>Harouni takes a similar tack, decontextualizing everyday symbols and patterns to create new and alluring abstract images. Ali Medina compounds the hybrid imagery in her explosive abstract works with multifarious textures — her lightweight and luminescent pieces mark each shift in color and surface with literal cuts in the paper. Sarah Smith bridges the exhibition’s abstract and figurative camps with non-figurative works that so convincingly portray common and everyday textures like dust and water that they could just as credibly be labeled photorealistic.</p><p>Whether they do so to better evoke the temperatures and surfaces of a given space, or to heighten our awareness of everyday patterns and patinas, these five artists all heighten the impact of their prints by appealing to viewers’ sense of touch.</p><p></p>"},"id":"be470f30-a298-45f8-aec5-30bc2e4c92e2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://n34QGkRcjH3OBXKU","text":"Press Release"},"id":"88d41ecc-c44f-44c7-bb7c-08f8016a3df0","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Jaishri Abichandani</p><p>Reception: Wednesday, September 25, 6-8 pm<br>Exhibition Dates: September 18 – November 17, 2013<br>Hours: Monday – Friday, 10am-6pm; Saturday – Sunday, 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Roses By Other Names guest curated by artist Jaishri Abichandani. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from September 18 – November 17, 2013 with a public reception on Wednesday, September 25, from 6-8pm.</p><p>Roses By Other Names includes divergent works by artists exploring the relationship of printmaking to photography, painting, and sculpture, and the slippage between text and image. The works in the exhibition quote photography by exaggerating pixels to the verge of abstraction or destruction (Megan Berk, Jay Zehngebot, and Gary Michaels); displace associative meanings between text and images (Teresa Lundgren and Rachael Abrams); or produce deeply intuitive works with embedded narratives and painterly overtones (Irena Pejovic and Ali Medina). Emily Noelle Lambert also presents whimsical representational portraiture and cityscapes that at first glance appear to be paintings; while Felix Plaza’s intricate cut-outs of garments and Liz Zanis’ necklace take a sculptural approach to extending the printmaking process out of traditional realms. The exhibition title refers to the works presented by Teresa Lundgren and Megan Berk, the diversity of artists within the exhibition and printmaking as the unifying activity behind all the works.</p>"},"id":"1c7b8a87-3a33-41e7-a27e-a74c451333a9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://1ZScFOLFzYb34Let","text":"Press Release"},"id":"cdd83b07-cd51-4853-8ba6-0b4d65689264","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Glen Baldridge</p><p>Opening Reception: Wednesday, September 14, 6-8pm<br>Exhibition Dates: September 14 – November 9, 2011<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Keyed , with a reception for artists on Wednesday, September 14 from 6-8pm. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from September 14 – November 9, 2011 and features new works on paper created by 17 artists currently in-residence. This exhibition represents recent works from current Keyholder Residency Program artists and participants in the Studio Rental Program. These prog rams provide NY area artists access to both affordable facilities and a close knit print community; both of which are essential to self publishing printmakers. The exhibited works are a great example of both the range of techniques and experimentation poss ible at the shop and the high caliber of work being produced there. As a former Keyholder, it is exciting to see the continuation of these programs and the expansion into the beautiful Midtown facilities. It continues to be a much needed contribution to printmaking in New York City and the print community at large. -Glen Baldridge</p>"},"id":"dddd9496-42f1-4521-a4ed-d86a46d36965","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://o5XErYiub7BAqD9y","text":"Press Release"},"id":"aa09a4b2-bfb8-4d14-aee5-173bda1043bc","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

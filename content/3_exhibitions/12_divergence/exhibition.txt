Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Rachel Gladfelter</p><p>Reception for artists: Wednesday, April 25, 6-8pm<br><br>Exhibition Dates: March 12 – May 7, 2012<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Divergence with a reception for artists on Wednesday, April 25 from 6-8pm. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from March 12 – May 7, 2012 and features new works created by 14 artists in residence. This exhibition presents work by Felipe Baeza, Audrey Cohn-Ganz, Priscila De Carvalho, Brad Ewing, Alex Gavryushenko, Shanti Grumbine, LNY, So Yoon Lym, Arturo Meade, Felix Plaza, Daniel Rich, David Rios Ferreira, Marie Schwartzapfel, and Justin Yockel. The exhibition is curated by Rachel Gladfelter, Associate Director at Pace Prints Chelsea.</p><p>The works included in this exhibition address diverse concepts surrounding divergence and longing. David Rios Ferreira’s A Shared Religion Proved a New Lesson conveys a repeated central figure taking flight, amongst nostalgic images pulled from a Walt Disney past. Felipe Baeza addresses a sense of religious dissemblance in Desaparaces, an etching with chine collé. Arturo Meade utilizes found objects (vinyl records), printing directly on their surfaces, thereby changing the utilitarian course of the object’s past. Shanti Grumbine literally and laboriously excises the content from the New York Times, evolving the work through the process of kenosis. An elegant simplicity of two converging and diverging lines, Brad Ewing’s Margin XIII —margins ever changing. </p><p>For all 14 artists, their new works demonstrate delight and curiosity in experimenting with materials and concepts, and a desire to explore new possibilities in their artistic practice. The Lower East Side Printshop allows artists the freedom and range to experiment in the printmaking process via their Keyholder Residencies and Studio Rental programs.</p>"},"id":"28432edc-ee57-4801-83ca-00d8db32818e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://DFR3hOb14tOBKp3q","text":"Press Release"},"id":"3e8c75a5-feb4-4409-94bb-216f245b7929","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

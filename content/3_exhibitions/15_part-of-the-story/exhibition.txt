Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Julian Kreimer</p><p>Exhibition reception: Wednesday, April 3, from 6 – 8pm<br>Exhibition Dates: March 20 – May 12, 2013<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Part of the Story guest curated by artist and critic Julian Kreimer. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from March 20 – May 12, 2013 with a public reception on Wednesday, April 3, from 6-8pm. Walking down the street you see a torn piece of paper, written on it are a few sentences, the middle of a letter, a journal entry, a homework assignment? This fragmentary glimpse intrudes into the routine of your day, alternately nagging and inspiring. You want to know more, but never will.</p><p>The artworks in this exhibition share a certain opacity. They are images of scenes, possible views, propositions. In all of them we feel we are getting a part of a larger story, but that larger story is kept from us.</p><p>In Kymia Nawabi’s and Rebecca Bird’s prints, we are privy to rituals and views that have the powerful logic of dreams we only partially remember. Liz Zanis’ prints and objects inject a funny sense of the uncanny into the everyday. Megan Berk’s images suggest a vision we might see at night before we understand what it is we are looking at. Colored lines partially hide photos of hard-to-place locales in</p><p>Daniele Genadry’s work, while Rachael Abrams uses geometric imagery to simultaneously reveal and obfuscate her texts. Long-past avant-gardes revive in Amanda Keeley’s semi-invented publications. Charles Koegel’s small altered newspaper clipping and Brad Ewing’s collaborative print made with</p><p>Fumi Mini Nakamura suggest cartoons missing their explanatory text, reversing the way we expect to read them.</p><p>Our quickness to google the slightest question suggests our unease with the unknown. By revealing only part of the story, these works make that discomfort central to their meaning.</p>"},"id":"ad4b5e12-9b5c-430f-94d2-166983d34765","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://OfSyLSrECLpwZruY","text":"Press Release"},"id":"0daf8f7f-873e-4994-b7fa-474edbc0e828","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

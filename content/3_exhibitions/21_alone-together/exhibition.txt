Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Beth Citron</p><p>Opening Reception: Tuesday, September 29, from 6 – 8pm<br>Exhibition Dates: September 29, 2015 – November 15, 2015<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Alone Together guest curated by Beth Citron. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from September 29 - November 15, 2015 with a public reception on Tuesday, September 29, 6 - 8pm.</p><p>The phrase \"Alone Together\" alludes to two seemingly opposing themes: the particularity of alienation today in spite of urban living and technology that are meant to bring us closer, and the comforting state of being 'alone, together' with a loved one or community. The exhibition includes work encompassed by both meanings, on the one hand reflecting emptied out landscapes and an image of a television news anchor joined only by virtual companions: projections of two correspondents and her own mirror image; the second expression can be seen in two representations of mothers breastfeeding their babies and in a print depicting a flock of birds isolated in space. Taken together, the works in this exhibition comprise a partial portrait of the contradictions and evolution of contemporary life, as articulated through a range of printmaking techniques and processes.</p><p>The title is taken from a series of prints in the exhibition, and in the context of those works by So Yoon Lym it refers specifically to the changing urban landscape of the \"silk city\" Paterson, New Jersey, and to the CMYK printing process. The exhibition includes works by Guy Ben-Ari, Noa Charuvi, Dana Kadison, So Yoon Lym, Felix Plaza, Bundith Phunsombatlert, and Anya Zelinska.</p>"},"id":"ccfd468f-32ca-42aa-96b3-e313fb1fa43e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://q3iuPxhIJihlo1dm","text":"Press Release"},"id":"b68cf43a-277b-41b8-8cb1-7d42cfadd2ca","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

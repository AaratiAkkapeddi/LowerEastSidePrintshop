Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Curated by Saya Woolfalk</p><p>Reception: Thursday, April 10, from 6 – 8pm</p><p>Exhibition Dates: March 19 – May 11, 2014<br>Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Language Forged Out of Place guest curated by artist Saya Woolfalk. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from March 19 – May 11, 2014 with a public reception on Thursday, April 10, from 6-8pm. The work submitted was laid out on the table and I looked closely at each piece seeking points of connection. Questions: What are these people thinking about? Who did they come in contact with?</p><p>What does it mean to make work in a printshop? I made my selections by answering these questions using what I saw on that table: a group of artists grappling with printmaking as a medium and context, while accidentally or intentional ly creating a common jive.</p><p>Each artist has created a particular language that collectively can be seen as a metaphor for how we remember and communicate through the printed form. Felix Plaza collects and displays a colorful grid of pop and historical imagery. Daniel Vasquez and Theresa Bloise make prints that evoke pictographic languages that might be used to write a new history of the world. Gianluca Rossitto , allows us to see traces of the image as it quickly fades into memory, while Golnar Adili's image insists upon its existence through obsessive stitching onto the printed surface.</p>"},"id":"007c0fa6-ffac-4d50-a64a-eb08e3f3c5c6","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://rUHS9UIdVVEfFnz7","text":"Press Release"},"id":"ca8f5a11-fe07-4401-9831-8cc1bb4ff537","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Reception: Wednesday, July 30, 6-8 pm</p><p>Exhibition Dates: July 16 – September 21, 2014<br>Hours: Monday – Friday, 10am-6pm; Saturday – Sunday, 12 - 6pm<br>Free and open to the public</p><p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present In and Out of Context guest curated by Hallie Ringle, Curatorial Assistant at The Studio Museum in Harlem. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from July 16 – September 21, 2014 with a public reception on Wednesday, July 30, from 6-8pm.</p><p>The prints in this exhibition stem from a common sense of disconnection. Some of the works display a literal sense of division, as is the case in Golnar Adili’s Work Pillow (2013) and Patience (2013).</p><p>Others include disembodied objects that allude to voices, objects, and context unseen such as Bundith Phunsombatlert’s Blank Sheet of Paper 1 (2014) who removes words from a protestor’s sign, echoing both a silent protest in Thailand as well as issues of access, equality and freedom of expression. Similarly, Camilo Godoy’s minimalist presidential signature, Ronald Reagan (AIDS, War on Drugs, Central America, etc.) (2014), and x-ray images of migrants Guests and Aliens (2014) are divorced from visual context yet simultaneously entrenched in the politics of the era.</p><p>Several artists use objects that are separated from their original circumstances as tools or inspiration. Printmaker Daniel Vasquez utilizes found processed plywood, severed from its intended use, to create large woodblock prints reminiscent of Ghanaian Adinkra fabrics. Likewise, Katherine</p><p>Tzu-Lan Mann samples freely from braids of hair, motifs from Beijing opera costumes and other forms of adornment, removing each disparate pattern from its common setting and placing them in conversation on the same printed and painted paper. Whether expressed as a physical or contextual condition or used as tools and inspiration, each artist in this exhibition engages with a sense of division from a political or cultural world.</p>"},"id":"1e232214-4be7-485b-b0d1-f4214f14b099","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://isojteex6zItIhnA","text":"Press Release"},"id":"46222966-6034-43f8-a019-fca6a488be9b","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from September 26 – November 25, 2018 with a public reception on Wednesday, September 26, 6 – 8pm. A modernist ruin sinks into a stream in Michelle Gevint’s digital composite print Untitled (Urban Speculation) . Its curved form is mirrored by its reflection, creating a dystopic portal. Her aluminum prints appropriate photographs of urban sprawl to meditate on the aerial view, a technology of vision used by colonial states, urban planners and the military alike. Umber Majeed’s Hypersurface of the</p><p>Present brings the failures of architectural modernism into conversation with postcoloniality and excess. Both the installation, and the hallucinogenic single-channel video In the Name of Hypersurface of the Present , playfully deconstruct processes of vision, nation-building and the digital and religious valences of the color green. Ethan Greenbaum's diptych reproduces the repetition and layering found in the built environment in the artist’s own multi-layered printing process. Kaela Mei-Chee Chambers frames an architectural vignette of brightly hued, perspectivally receding archways that are inviting but impenetrable. Felix Plaza’s PANOPLIA -AUTORITRATTO -TELA BLU , a silkscreened cloth is populated with images ranging from du-rag packaging, to musical scores, mixing the purportedly “high” and “low” to create a self-portrait of the artist’s affinities with particular objects. Doug</p><p>Collins’s etchings are softly rendered abstract landscapes, responses to translations of the poet Meng Hao-ran. Hannah Smith Allen superimposes chat bubbles and border walls onto pixellated photographs of the U.S.-Mexico border, evoking questions of discrimination and citizenship.</p><p>*The exhibition title is drawn from Eduardo C. Corral’s poem “Border Triptych” (2012).</p>"},"id":"df3a1393-2716-4bd3-9afb-bc03948028e7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"link":"file://WtlbbVyerLHW1oQd","text":"Press Release"},"id":"8b4bafa4-6ed9-41b8-89d2-208ee5986766","isHidden":false,"type":"button"}]

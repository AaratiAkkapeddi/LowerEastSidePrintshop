Bio: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Lower East Side Printshop published a portfolio of 10 prints, <em>When, if ever, does one draw a line under the horrors of history in the interest of truth and reconciliation? A timeline of the recent political history of ten countries in conflict&nbsp;</em>by artist Carlos Motta through the Printshop’s Special Editions in 2008. These prints&nbsp;depict the outline of the geographical map of 10 countries, which are going through serious political conflicts that have seemed irreconcilable.&nbsp; A small reader that presents a very detailed chronology of the political history of each country accompanies the prints. The work advocates for the construction of a space of memory and remembrance in order to think again about the horrors of history.</p><p>The countries are: Colombia, Cuba, Iraq, North and South Korea, Myanmar, Palestine, Sudan, Tibet (China), Zimbabwe and a (utopian) reconfiguration of the map of Central and South America to reflect the wish of continental political and cultural unity.</p><p><strong>Carlos Motta</strong> is a Colombian-born, New York based, interdisciplinary artist. Motta’s work is in the permanent collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Guggenheim Museum, New York; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Barcelona; Museu Fundaçao Serralves, Porto; and Museo de Arte de Banco de la República, Bogotá; among&nbsp;others.</p>"},"id":"3c166625-9f4a-467c-a677-f8e0732006f0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]

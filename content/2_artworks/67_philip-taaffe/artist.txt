Bio: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Two variable editions,&nbsp;<em>Extinct Leaf Page&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lizard Page</em>&nbsp;were created by&nbsp;acclaimed artist Philip Taaffe as E/AB Fair’s&nbsp;2016 benefit prints.&nbsp;These monoprints are indicative of Taaffe’s lasting fascination with nature.&nbsp;<em>Extinct Leaf Page</em>&nbsp;was created from a fossil the artist found, and depicts leaves from an extinct plant.&nbsp;<em>Lizard Page</em>&nbsp;reveals an artful composition of lizards with unusual markings. This image was inspired by the carved lizards and toads that adorn the handrail leading to the pulpit of the renowned Viennese church of St. Stephen, symbolizing the fight between good and evil.</p><p><strong>Philip Taaffe</strong>&nbsp;was born in Elizabeth, NJ, and studied at the Cooper Union in New York.

Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>2-Day Weekend Workshop, 12-5pm<br>April 26 – 27, 2025</p><p>Fee:&nbsp;<strong>$300</strong>&nbsp;including materials and 10 hours of studio time</p><p>Explore the diverse techniques and infinite possibilities of collagraph—a print made from a plate collaged with varied components. You will build your plate by layering flat found objects, glues and grits, your favorite materials, such as lace, papers, leaves, tin foil, cards, and anything else you desire. We will then experiment with a wide range of inking techniques that will add tones, lines, shapes, and embossments to your images. We will also cover printing essentials including paper trimming, setting up the printing press, ink modification, and registration. This class uses non-toxic, water-based inks.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sidetimestudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Madden</a> is the printer, owner, and operator of SRM Editions, a professional intaglio editions studio, and of Sidetime Studio, an educational print studio for artists and others interested in printmaking.
